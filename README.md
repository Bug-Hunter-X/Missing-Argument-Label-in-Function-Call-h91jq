# Missing Argument Label in Function Call

This example demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include argument labels when calling a function with multiple parameters.  The `calculateArea` function requires both `width` and `height` to be provided, each with its label.  The incorrect usage omits the label for `height`, resulting in a compiler error.

The solution shows the correct way to call the function.
